Weather pupdates with dog-appropriate activity suggestions. 

You'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to run this app, to build the application on an emulator, you can follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run).

This project also relies on the presence of an `apikey.properties` file at the root of the project, which contains the two API keys needed to retrieve OpenWeatherMaps data & GooglePlay location services.  The contents of the file are formatted like so: 

```
OPEN_WEATHER_MAPS_KEY="API_KEY_HERE"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="GOOGLE_PLAY_API_KEY_HERE"
```
